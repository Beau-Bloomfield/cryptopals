# cryptopals
My solutions to the Cryptopals challenges.
I implemented the first few challenges are implemented in C in order to brush up on and exhibit my C skills.
Eventually, the exercises became more intricate, so I switched to Python in the interest of expedience.

At a few points I did need to reference the work of other persons when I got stuck.  These instances should be mentioned throughout the comments,
but in particular the solutions of Michael Cypher (presumably a pseudony? https://cypher.codes/writing/cryptopals-challenge-set-3) were helpful.
